## Settings

![settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tsuk1ko/nhentai-helper/master/docs/settings.png)

- **Download thread**  
  If you think the download speed is too slow, you can try to increase the number of download threads from this setting.
- **Open on new tab**  
  Gallery page will be open on a new window by default, turn off it if you don't like it.
- **Custom download URL**  
  **WARNING: Please don't set this if you don't know what it does.**  
  Tip: You may need to add your domain into *XHR security* for this script.  
  Provide a URL containing the following placeholder:
  - `{{mid}}` - Media ID
  - `{{index}}` - Page index, starting from 1
  - `{{ext}}` - Image file extension
- **Compression filename**  
  Default is `{{japanese}}.zip`. You can custom the naming of downloaded compression file, including the file extension, such as `{{english}}.cbz`.  
  Available placeholders:  
  - `{{english}}` - English name of manga
  - `{{japanese}}` - Japanese name of manga
  - `{{pretty}}` - English simple title of manga
  - `{{id}}` - Gallery ID
  - `{{pages}}` - Number of pages
- **Compression level**  
  Accept a numer in `0-9`, default is `0`.  
  `0` means "no compression", `1` means "best speed", `9` means "best compression".  
   Actually, for manga, compression output size of `0` and `9` usually differ by less than **1%**.
- **Filename length**  
  Zeros will be padded to the start of image filename when its length lower than the value you specified. This can avoid the sorting confusion caused by sorting only by string in some cases.  
  Accept a nonnegative integer or `auto`.
- **Auto cancel downloaded manga**  
  When you are going to download an already downloaded manga, it will be canceled automatically instead of pop-up a confirmation box.
- **Auto retry when error occurs**  
  Automatically retry when an error occurs, instead of pop-up a confirmation box.
- **Auto show all**  
  Help you to click the "Show all" button on manga detail page automatically.
- **Show ignore button**
  Show an button that allow you to mark or unmark the manga as downloaded.
- **Compression "streamFiles"**  
  Enable this option will use less memory but some program might not support the generated zip file.  
  See [here](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/documentation/api_jszip/generate_async.html#streamfiles-option) for more information.
- **Series mode**  
  Enable this option will make downloading and compression become series tasks but not parallel to reduce memory usage.  
  If `RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed` occurs frequently, you can try to enable it.
- **Stream download**  
  Use [StreamSaver.js](https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js) to download zip stream to reduce memory usage.  
  But this not work on Safari and Firefox, and the download process is **extremely slow**. So not recommended unless you really have memory usage issues.
